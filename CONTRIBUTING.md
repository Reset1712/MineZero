# Contributing to MineZero

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MineZero! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/AMPerez04/MineZero/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork MineZero](https://github.com/AMPerez04/MineZero/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

## Getting started

- Clone the repository.
- Switch to the branch that matches your desired version and loader (e.g., 1.20.1-forge).
- Import into your modding environment (Forge/NeoForge/Fabric).
- Build with Gradle.

## Making your changes

- **Code Style**: Please follow the existing code style.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
- **Documentation**: Update the `README.md` and other relevant documentation if you are adding or changing functionality.

## Submitting your pull request

- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to link the PR to the issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- Once you submit your PR, a MineZero team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge conflicts, check out a Git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
