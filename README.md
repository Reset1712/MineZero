# MineZero

**MineZero** is a Minecraft mod inspired by *Re:Zero* that introduces a **checkpoint and world reset system**. When the designated **anchor player** dies, the entire world (including players, entities, and blocks) is restored to the last checkpoint — effectively letting you "return by death."

---

## Features

* **Checkpoints**

  * Set manually with the `/setcheckpoint` command (OP level 2).
  * Use the **Artifact Flute** item to set a checkpoint instantly.
  * Saves player data, inventory, health, hunger, XP, potion effects, advancements, and dimension.
  * Saves world data including block states, entities, items on the ground, and time of day.

* **Anchor Player System**

  * Only the **anchor player’s death** triggers a reset.
  * The anchor player is set automatically when they create a checkpoint.

* **World Reset on Death**

  * Restores players to their saved states.
  * Resets world blocks, entities, and items.
  * Rewinds daytime.
  * Plays a custom **death chime** sound.
