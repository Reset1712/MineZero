MineZero is a tactical checkpoint mod that allows players to set checkpoints and reset the world upon death. Inspired by _Re:Zero_, it works in both single-player and multiplayer. The last player to set a checkpoint becomes the "anchor," whose death resets the world and restores all players to their saved states, including inventory, health, hunger, fire ticks, and XP.

**Key Features:**

*   **Inspired by Re:Zero**: Tactical resets based on checkpoints just like Subaru Natsuki.
*   **Artifact Flute**: Set checkpoints instantly with a special item.
*   **Multiplayer Support**: Anchor system ensures a cooperative challenge.
*   **Entity and Item Restoration**: Resets all mobs, players, blocks, and ground items.
*   **Enhanced Aesthetic**: Uses textures from [unused-textures](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures).

Perfect for survival challenges, adventure maps, and roleplaying, MineZero offers a unique twist to your gameplay.

### Looking for More _Re:Zero_ in Minecraft?

If you're a fan of _Re:Zero_, you might want to check out [_Re:Zero Experience_](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/re-zero-experience) by Zoomerreid. It adds characters, magic, and abilities straight from the series, making for a pretty unique experience.

While _MineZero_ focuses on **Return by Death**, _Re:Zero Experience_ brings in **Witch Factors, Divine Protections, and battles against major enemies** from the anime. The mods aren’t officially integrated, but they both add different pieces of the _Re:Zero_ world to Minecraft. If you're into the series, it's worth a look.
